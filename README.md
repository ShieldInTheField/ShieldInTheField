## Hi there 👋

I’m an embedded systems engineer and a physicist who finds beauty both in the **certainty of embedded design** and the **uncertainty of quantum mechanics**.

---

### 💻 What I Do

My work focuses on **bare-metal firmware**, **low-level system design**, and **real-time embedded control**, often in industrial contexts like motor drives, motion controllers, and sensor feedback systems.  
I enjoy meaningful, structured conversations around systems, and I’d be glad to exchange ideas in any of these areas, to contribute, learn, or help where I can.

### 📚 Currently Learning

On the software side, I’m focused on:

- **Expanding from bare-metal to kernel-level development**
- Understanding how embedded software can serve beyond automation, in systems programming, OS-level tooling, or device abstraction

On the physics side, I’m expanding my understanding of:

- **Differential Geometry** and its role in GR and classical gravity  
- **Relativistic Quantum Mechanics** and the structure of physical theories    
- Bridging theory with computation and real-world modeling

### 🤔 Fun Fact

Although I know it’s not possible, I’m still trying to see over the horizon:)

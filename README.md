## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an embedded systems engineer and a physicist who finds beauty both in the **certainty of embedded design** and the **uncertainty of quantum mechanics**.

### ðŸ§­ My Approach

**Learning is the default.**  
I donâ€™t just want things to work, I want to know *why* they work. What are the principles underneath? How does the system behave at the lowest level?

I think in terms of **structure, constraints, and flow** â€” whether itâ€™s firmware for real-time control, or mathematical frameworks in theoretical physics.  
I value **clarity**, **determinism**, and **well-structured design**, whether I'm writing code or solving tensor equations.

### ðŸ’» What I Do

My work focuses on **bare-metal firmware**, **low-level system design**, and **real-time embedded control**, often in industrial contexts like motor drives, motion controllers, and sensor feedback systems.  
I enjoy meaningful, structured conversations around systems, and Iâ€™d be glad to exchange ideas in any of these areas, to contribute, learn, or help where I can.

### ðŸ“š Currently Learning

On the physics side, Iâ€™m expanding my understanding of:

- **Differential Geometry** and its role in GR and classical gravity  
- **Relativistic Quantum Mechanics** and the structure of physical theories    
- Bridging theory with computation and real-world modeling

On the software side, Iâ€™m focused on:

- **Expanding from bare-metal to kernel-level development**
- Understanding how embedded software can serve beyond automation â€” in systems programming, OS-level tooling, or device abstraction

### ðŸ¤” Fun Fact

Although I know itâ€™s not possible, Iâ€™m still trying to see over the horizon:)
